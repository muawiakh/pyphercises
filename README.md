### Problem: Shortest distance between words

You have a file containing a long list of words. Write a function that, given any two words, finds the shortest distance
between them in terms of numbers of words in between. e.g.
"find the shortest distance between two words" -> Difference between `find` and `distance` should be `2`
It can be case insensitive.

#### How to run?

For a very basic test:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/muawiakh/pyphercises.git
$ cd pyphercises/pyphercises/
$ python3 pyphercises.py
.. Enter word one to find> "<input1>"
.. Enter word two to find> "<input2>"
.. Shortest distance between 'input1' and 'input2': <shortest-distance>
```
